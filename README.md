# Forest-Fire-detection-System
Developing a project for identifying the forest fire and wildfire system. The forest fire or wildfire is an uncontrollable fire that develops in a forest. All the  forest fir will create havoc during weekends on the animal habitat, surrounding environment and human property. k-means clustering can be used for the identification  of the  crucial hotspots during forest fire  and to reduce the  severity , to regulate them and even  to predict the behaviour of the wildfire. This is advantageous for allocating the required resources. To enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy, it is ideal to use climatological data to find out the common periods and seasons for wildfires.
